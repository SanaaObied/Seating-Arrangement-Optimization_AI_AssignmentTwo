                                                          Overview: Seating Arrangement Optimization
This project aims to find the optimal seating arrangement for 10 people to minimize discomfort based on a dislike matrix. The seating arrangement is circular, and the total cost is calculated by summing the dislike costs between adjacent individuals. Three optimization techniques will be used:

Genetic Algorithm (GA): Evolves a population of seating arrangements using selection, crossover, and mutation to find the best arrangement.
Simulated Annealing (SA): Uses a cooling schedule to probabilistically accept worse solutions and escape local minima, aiming to find a low-cost arrangement.
Hill Climbing (HC): Iteratively improves a seating arrangement by exploring neighboring configurations, with multiple restarts to enhance solution quality.
The effectiveness of each technique will be evaluated based on the total seating cost, and the best arrangements from each method will be compared.
